# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
In this project, I have learned:
- the basics of programming in Python: common data types, list and for loops, dictionaries, frequency tables, functions, etc.;
- explored and cleaned data;
- isolated data to get needed information; and
- produced insights and suggestions for app development plans.

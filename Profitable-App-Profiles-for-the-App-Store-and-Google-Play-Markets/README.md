# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
In this project, I have learned to:
- use the basics of programming in Python: common data types, list and for loops, dictionaries, frequency tables, functions, etc.;
- explore and clean data;
- isolate data to get needed information; and
- produce insights and suggestions for app development plans.
